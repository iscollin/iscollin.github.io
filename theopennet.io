<h1>The fight for a open web is here if your ready to fight for it you've come to the right place</h1>
<p>Without net neutrality your ISP can slow down or speed up preferred URL's they can also just cut it altogether so if they dont like a webpage they can prevent you from visiting it. With net neutrality we can stop this and allow everyone to visit everyones website no matter the topic of the website</p>
<p> Sadly for some reasone we have voted out net neutrality as you may have heard but this is'nt the end of the war of an open internet you can visit www.github.com to call your representative and help bring back net neurality</p>
<p> BTW if you would like to have a website made for you just let me know this site will be updated in the future to inclue a way to contact me </p>
